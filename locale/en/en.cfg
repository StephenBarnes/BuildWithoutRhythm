[mod-setting-description]
BuildWithoutRhythm-block-inserters=Set to 0 to disable. If enabled, when you try to place an inserter, the mod will prevent it if the inserter forms a line of 3 equally-spaced inserters, with end-to-end length less than this setting. Trios that are longer than this distance are allowed. All these other settings work the same way.
BuildWithoutRhythm-block-assemblers=This includes assembling machines, oil refineries, chemical plants, centrifuges, and modded buildings that function like an assembler.
